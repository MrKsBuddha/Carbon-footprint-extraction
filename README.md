# Carbon-footprint-extraction
A lightweight Chrome extension that estimates the carbon footprint of items on Amazon and Flipkart. It scrapes product/cart data, applies simple emission factors, and shows a floating widget with per-item and total COâ‚‚e. Runs locally in the browser with no backend, for demo and educational use.
